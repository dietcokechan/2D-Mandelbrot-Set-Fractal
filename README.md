# 2D-Mandelbrot-Set-Fractal
A simple 2D Mandelbrot Set fractal that I coded (almost) from scratch using SDL2    
  
It can zoom into the fractal and it takes a screenshot on every zoom    
  
You can collect the screenshots and make a video of the zooms using ffmpeg in cmd    
  
This is how the [screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/WFairgd) look like in the folder    
  
And this is the [video output](https://imgur.com/a/yRL0Lil) from ffmpeg (a bit choppy from converting to .gif though)
